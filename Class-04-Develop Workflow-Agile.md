## Waterfall to Agile

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a process used by development teams to design and build high-quality software cost-effectively and efficiently. The goal is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond.

### SDLC Models: Waterfall & V Model

There are three main models:

- **Waterfall Model**: A sequential design process where progress flows downwards through phases like a waterfall.
- **V Model**: An extension of the Waterfall model, where the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, forming a V shape.

As DevOps professionals, it's crucial to learn from Agile environments and understand both methodologies' strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge helps improve team processes using appropriate methodologies and tools.

### Waterfall

In traditional project management, the Waterfall model is used where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. The model focuses on strict processes, making it difficult to go back to a previous phase.

### Agile

Agile development is an iterative methodology emphasizing flexibility, human communication, feedback, and producing working results.

#### SDLC Model - Agile

Agile is a practice-based methodology for modeling and documenting software-based systems, focusing on values, principles, and practices for a flexible approach to software development. Each cycle is an iteration, called a Sprint, usually lasting 2-3 weeks. This approach involves frequent small-scale deliveries, feedback collection, and risk minimization.

### Agile vs. Waterfall

- **Traditional (Waterfall)**: Clear roles, detailed documentation, heavy handoffs.
- **Modern (Agile)**: Members wear multiple hats, emphasizing broader knowledge and skills.

### Agile Values

- **Individuals and Interactions**
- **Working Software**
- **Customer Collaboration**
- **Responding to Change**

### 12 Agile Principles

1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
2. Welcome changing requirements.
3. Frequent delivery of working software.
4. Daily collaboration between business people and developers.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
6. Promote sustainable development.
7. Working software as the primary measure of progress.
8. Face-to-face conversation as the best form of communication.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity.
11. Self-organizing teams.
12. Regular reflection on how to become more effective.

### Why Agile?

Agile principles focus on quick feedback, value delivery, iterative development, waste reduction, and continuous improvement.

### Agile Mindset

- Frequent delivery over big bang projects.
- Iterative development.
- Continuous improvement.
- Teamwork over individual effort.
- Cross-functional teams.
- Team autonomy.

## Common Interview Questions

1. How do you like to work?
2. Give an example of a project that didn't go well.
3. Why do you think it was a failure?
4. What could have been done differently to turn it into success?

## Agile Framework and Practices

### Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework for addressing complex problems while delivering high-value products. It is lightweight, simple to understand, but difficult to master.

#### Scrum 3355

- **3 Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team Members
- **3 Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **5 Events**: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
- **Value Propositions**: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage

#### Scrum Master

- Leadership role.
- Protects the team from outside interruptions.
- QA check.
- Team building.
- Recruitment.
- Meeting facilitation.
- Not a manager but a helper.

#### Product Backlog

An ordered list of features that need to be delivered to create or enhance the product. The highest value items and those containing the most risk should be prioritized.

#### User Story

Describes a ticket in the form of: "As a [user], I want [to do something] so that [I can achieve some purpose]."

#### Task Estimation

Team members estimate task difficulty and reach a consensus.

#### Scrum Meetings

- **Sprint Planning**: Extract tasks for the Sprint.
- **Daily Scrum**: Discuss what was done yesterday, what will be done today, and any help needed.
- **Sprint Review**: Present a demo to stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

### Kanban

Manages and tracks Sprint progress using a visual board. Tasks move from left to right, with exceptions like testing and review.

### Other Agile Ceremonies

- 1:1 Meetings
- Demo Sessions
- Test/QA Demos
- Brainstorming/Spiking

### Common Tools

- Azure DevOps
- Jira Software
- Trello
- GitHub Projects

### Best Development Practices

- **CI/CD**
- **Pair Programming**: One codes, one reviews.
- **Code Quality & Refactoring**: Regular code review and improvement.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before code to improve quality.

### Scenario: Microsoft - Windows 10

#### Windows as a Service (WaaS)

- **Transition from Waterfall to Agile**:
  - Personal offices to team rooms.
  - Long planning cycles to continual planning and learning.
  - Detailed spec documents to specs in PowerPoint.
  - Long development cycles to 3-week Sprints.

#### Teams

- Team structure and roles evolved.

### Self-Forming Teams

Team members can change roles every 18 months to maintain team dynamism.

### Sprint Mail

Use emails to start or review each Sprint.
